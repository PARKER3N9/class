        <h3>Hick's Law</h3>

        <p class="lawPara">
          Hick's Law is summarized as the more decisions there are the
          longer it will take for someone to make a choice from them.
          I believe Amazon does an amazing job of this and "helping" their
          customers buy more of their products through it. In the picture
          above, sure there is a navbar and some advertisements but there
          is only one product! It is "the deal of the day" meaning it is a
          good buy too because it is on sale. There are no other options to
          look at for the deals, just one right there for someone to
          take advantage of.

        <h3>White Space</h3>
        <h4>ESPN</h4>
        <p><a href="https://www.Amazon.com/">See ESPN Score Live!</a><br>
          <br>

        <p class="lawPara">
          White Space and Clean Design is the ability to use space that
          is unused as a tool within the design of something like a website.
          It creates clear breaks and shows where content shifts will be
          happening. As seen here ESPN does a great job in
          doing this. You can see a break from navBar to first div.
          This div is broken up into 4 sections; a live score, a headline o
          f a recent play in the game with a picture of the player it is
          headlining, a smaller headline from the pregame and
          then a gamecast and boxscore link. Under that it has another
          break through white space into games that are waiting to happen.
          It is a great example of using those spaces to your advantage.

        <h3>PARC: Alignment</h3>
        <h4>Nike</h4>
        <p><a href="https://www.nike.com/">Visit Nike Now</a><br>
          <br>
          <img src="img/nike.jpeg" alt="Nike Phone Homepage">
        </p>
        <p class="lawPara">
          The definition of Alignment is "Arrangement in a straight line,
          or correct or appropriate relative positions." As you can see,
          Nike's website is fantastic at it! The content, including that
          found in the navBar are all aligned on the sides thus creating a
           pleasing aesthetic to the eye. Everything lines up very well and
          creates an overall great look for a site.
